#declare WordGame class 
  #Initialize class method 
    #input: word 
    #steps:
      #Initialize instance variables for: 
        #An array thats made of the word's characters
        #A guess counter
        #The amount of guesses allowed
        #an empty array to store the guessed letters 
        #A new word array that stores the current word w/ the guessed letters. 
   #Set getter methods for all instance variables 
   #Def method for when a guess is entered
    #input: a letter 
    #steps:
      #Store letter entered into the guessed letter array. 
    #output: updated guessed letters array.  
   #Def method that evaluates the letter entered 
   #input: a letter 
   #steps:
      
        #IF the letter entered is in the word to guess, 
          #Find all indexes of that letter in the word and store that in new index array 
          #ITERATE through EACH index array and replace the letter guessed in the new word array.
   #output: new word array.     
#For user interface
  #Ask user for a word. 
  #WHILE loop will run 
    #until reached guessed allowed OR word is guessed
      #Ask user for guess
      #IF the letter entered is NOT present in the guessed_letters array, 
        #Increase the guess count by 1. 
      #Call instance methods 
      #prints new word array joined w/ spaces in between. 
  #IF user guesses correctly,  
    #Prints a congrats message
