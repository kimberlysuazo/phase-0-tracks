You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
Query:
SELECT * FROM businesses INNER JOIN reviews  
ON businesses.id=reviews.business_id
INNER JOIN users ON users.id=reviews.user_id; 

Output:
4|Lotus Yoga|1|4|great instructors, very clean space|4|2|2|Mandy|Kaling
3|The Beagle Nightclub|2|2|too much country music|3|1|1|Bradford|Pitt
3|The Beagle Nightclub|3|5|Amazing! country music all night long!!|3|5|5|Holly|Berry
5|Plumbing by Janet|4|4|janet sure knows how to plumb|5|2|2|Mandy|Kaling


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
Query:
SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
FROM businesses   
INNER JOIN reviews  
ON businesses.id=reviews.business_id
INNER JOIN users  
ON users.id=reviews.user_id; 
Output: 
Lotus Yoga|Mandy|Kaling|4|great instructors, very clean space
The Beagle Nightclub|Bradford|Pitt|2|too much country music
The Beagle Nightclub|Holly|Berry|5|Amazing! country music all night long!!

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
Query:
SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
FROM businesses   
INNER JOIN reviews  
ON businesses.id=reviews.business_id
INNER JOIN users  
ON users.id=reviews.user_id
WHERE businesses.id=3;

Output: 
The Beagle Nightclub|Bradford|Pitt|2|too much country music
The Beagle Nightclub|Holly|Berry|5|Amazing! country music all night long!!
