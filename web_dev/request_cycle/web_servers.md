**What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?**
Linux is a free Os. It is open source. You can run the program for any purpose, change it and redistribute it for free. Linux has different versions called distributions (such as Ubuntu, Mint, Deepin). It is more customizable and there are more options for hardware than other operating systems. The difference between Linux and other major OSs is that it gives more power to the user. It assumes the user is computer-literate and it allows the user to do anything. 

**In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?**

A virtual private server is a virtual machine that is set up to receive and answer browser requests. It can be a chunk of memory that runs as its own entity, dedicated for that particular private server, and individually it runs its own operating system, programs and stores data.  
One of the advantages of a VPS, is its low cost. A business needing a dedicated website but doesnt have enough budget to run its own server, can use a VPS. Also, a VPS is customizable and memory is scalable. There is also root access allowed. 

**Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?**

The root account has absolute power over the system. Working as the root user is a bad idea because you can easily erase any important files by mistake. Also, it increases vulnerability of someone being able to attack your system because someone could exploit a programming error on a program installed, and if it's on the root, then they can take control of your whole system.
