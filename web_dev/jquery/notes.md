# My jquery study plan

1. First, do a general search on jquery to get a feel about the technology, what it encompasses and the resources available to learn it.
2. Look for cheat sheets and also for short videos that demonstrate some simple skills. 
3. As I encounter new methods and things I'm unfamiliar with, use w3 schools to get a better understanding about the syntax and of examples and stop to test. 
4. Start a a simple document where I can test out the smaller things I have been learning. Not exactly a program or project, just testing lines of code to see if Im actually learning how to use jquery. I find that I learn best by doing. a hands-on approach is best for me, so I will stop often to test what Ive just learned.
